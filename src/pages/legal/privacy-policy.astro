            <p>
                Currently, TMS List is a directory service and does not function
                as a healthcare provider. However, we take data privacy
                seriously. If you submit information through our "Talk to a
                Specialist" forms, that information is transmitted securely.
                Please do not submit sensitive medical records through standard
                contact forms unless explicitly directed to a HIPAA-compliant
                portal.
            </p>
