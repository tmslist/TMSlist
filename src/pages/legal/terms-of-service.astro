            <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
            <p>
                TMS List provides a directory of Transcranial Magnetic
                Stimulation (TMS) providers and educational content related to
                mental health treatments. We do not provide medical advice,
                diagnosis, or treatment. The content on this Site is for
                informational purposes only.
            </p>

            <h2>3. No Medical Advice</h2>
            <p>
                THE SITE DOES NOT PROVIDE MEDICAL ADVICE. The contents of the
                Site, such as text, graphics, images, and other material
                contained on the Site ("Content") are for informational purposes
                only. The Content is not intended to be a substitute for
                professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always
                seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health
                provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical
                condition.
            </p>

            <h2>4. User Responsibilities</h2>
            <p>
                You agree to use the Site only for lawful purposes. You are
                prohibited from violating or attempting to violate the security
                of the Site, including, without limitation, accessing data not
                intended for you or logging into a server or account which you
                are not authorized to access.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Provider Listings</h2>
            <p>
                We make reasonable efforts to ensure the accuracy of provider
                listings, but we do not warrant that any information is complete
                or error-free. Inclusion of a provider in our directory does not
                imply endorsement by TMS List.
            </p>

            <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>
                In no event shall TMS List, its affiliates, or their licensors,
                service providers, employees, agents, officers, or directors be
                liable for damages of any kind, under any legal theory, arising
                out of or in connection with your use, or inability to use, the
                Site.
            </p>

            <h2>7. Changes to Terms</h2>
            <p>
                We may revise and update these Terms of Service from time to
