            <h2>Not Medical Advice</h2>
            <p>
                The content content, including but not limited to text,
                graphics, images, and other material contained on TMS List ("the
                Site") is for **informational and educational purposes only**.
                No material on this site is intended to be a substitute for
                professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
            </p>

            <h2>Consult Your Doctor</h2>
            <p>
                Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified
                health care provider with any questions you may have regarding a
                medical condition or treatment and before undertaking a new
                health care regimen, and never disregard professional medical
                advice or delay in seeking it because of something you have read
                on this specific website.
            </p>

            <h2>No Doctor-Patient Relationship</h2>
            <p>
                Use of this Site does not establish a doctor-patient
                relationship. Submitting a form or contacting a clinic listed on
                this directory does not establish a doctor-patient relationship
                until you have been formally accepted as a patient by that
                specific provider.
            </p>

            <h2>Accuracy of Information</h2>
            <p>
                While we strive to provide accurate and up-to-date information,
                medical knowledge is constantly evolving. Transcranial Magnetic
                Stimulation (TMS) is an FDA-cleared treatment, but individual
                results may vary. We do not guarantee the accuracy,
                completeness, or usefulness of any information on the Site.
