    <p>
        TMS List was founded with a singular mission: to make advanced mental
        health treatments accessible to everyone. We believe that Transcranial
        Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a life-saving technology that is often
        buried under complex medical jargon and opaque pricing.

    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
    <p>
        To provide a comprehensive, verified, and patient-first directory of TMS
        clinics across the United States. We aim to bridge the gap between
        patients seeking relief from treatment-resistant depression and the
        compassionate providers who can help them.
    </p>

    <h3>What We Do</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Verify Data:</strong> We manually check clinic credentials, machine
            types, and insurance participation.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Educate:</strong> We translate clinical studies into plain English.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Advocate:</strong> We fight for better insurance coverage and
            transparency in healthcare costs.
        </li>
